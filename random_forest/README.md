# Random Forests!
> One of the most effective and easy-to-use machine learning algorithms out there

## What's a random forest?
See the slides!
slides.com/ClimbsRocks/randomForests

## PreCourse Steps:

* Fork and clone this repo (and I'm never opposed to some appreciation in the form of a star!)
* Download the kaggle data and move it to the right folder
    * https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
    * Move the data file to `learningMachines/random_forest/server/neuralNet/train.csv`, and make sure it is named `train.csv`
* Use the provided shell script to install dependencies

## Your turn!
Here are the things I expect you to do
[ ] Load in the random forest module
[ ] Finish up the data formatting
  [ ] Perform feature engineering
  [ ] Turn the dictionaries into vectors (what JS would call arrays)
[ ] Run the training data through the random forest

### Extra Credit
Use RandomizedSearchCV to find the best shape for your random forest!

### Fantasy Mode
Make a submission to the kaggle competition!
[ ] Download the testing dataset
[ ] Once you've trained up your random forest, use it to get predictions on the test data set
[ ] Write the predictions to a file
[ ] Upload this file to kaggle!
